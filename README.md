**SQReplay**

Massive thanks to [Draconis](https://github.com/dfitzpatrick) for reference documentation. The project would not be possible without him. 

For a much better example of how to use s2protocol, take a look at [ZCReplay](https://github.com/dfitzpatrick/zcl/tree/master/zclreplay).

```
Usage: sqreplay.py [-h] [--debug d] [--json j]

Squadron TD Game Parser - Processes .SC2Replay files.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --debug d   Activates Debug Mode.
  --json j    Dumps results to human-readable JSON format.
  ```

  **What does this program do?**
  Very little at the moment. Plans are (in the future) to use it to construct a front-end webapp that will let players see stats about themselves. However, that's still a long way away.
